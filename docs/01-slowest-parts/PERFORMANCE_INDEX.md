## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **Attention is the bottleneck** - O(n²) dominates for long sequences
2. **GQA is the best first step** - Proven, safe, 20-30% speedup
3. **Combine optimizations** - Stack them for 1.6-2× total speedup
4. **Profile before optimizing** - Know your actual bottlenecks
5. **Test quality carefully** - Speed is useless if model doesn't learn
